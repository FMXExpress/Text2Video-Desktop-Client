Built with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/) using the FireMonkey framework this client works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (and maybe Android+iOS) with a single codebase and single UI. At the moment it is specifically set up for Windows.

It also features a REST integration with Replicate.com for providing Generate Videp functionality within the client. You need to sign up for an API key to access that functionality. It also requires that you have Microsoft Edge installed.
